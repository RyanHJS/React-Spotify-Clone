# Spotify Web Playback

Spotify Web Playback is a TypeScript-enabled API for using the [Spotify Web Playback SDK].

The Spotify Web Playback SDK enables developers to stream and play Spotify tracks
in any web browser that supports [Encrypted Media Extensions]
(currently only FireFox, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge are supported).

Read the documentation [here][docs].

## Setup

Install spotify-web-playback by running:

    npm i -s spotify-web-playback

or

    yarn add spotify-web-playback

Web browsers can use:

```javascript
import Spotify from 'https://esm.sh/spotify-web-playback';
```

## Getting Started

```javascript
const token = '<SPOTIFY_TOKEN>';

const uri = 'spotify:track:54flyrjcdnQdco7300avMJ';

const spotify = new SpotifyPlayer();

await spotify.connect(token);

spotify.play(uri);
```

## Authorization

**This library does not handle obtaining a Spotify token. You have to take care of that yourself.**

You have two options:

1. Click [here] to obtain a temporary token. You can pass it to your code, but be aware it will expire after one hour.
2. Use the Spotify Web API to obtain an access token. See [this gist] for a full example of how to obtain a Spotify token in a web application. This workflow is highly recommended for production apps.

An example of #2 is included. Please see [demo.mjs](demo.mjs) and [public/demo.mjs](public/demo.mjs) for more information.
Set `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` then run `npm run demo` and open `http://localhost:8989/` to view the demo.
